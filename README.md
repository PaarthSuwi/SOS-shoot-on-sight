# SOS-shoot-on-sight
AI-powered turret system that detects, tracks, and targets objects using vision and gesture control. It combines OpenCV, MediaPipe, and machine learning with PID control for precise, autonomous operation.

## Features
- Real-time motion and object detection
- YOLO-based threat identification
- PID-controlled turret accuracy
- Thrust Vector Control for rocket simulation
- Modular hardware & software design

## Technologies
- Python, OpenCV, Raspberry Pi
- YOLOv5, Kalman Filters, CNN/SVM models
- 3D CAD design, PID simulation in MATLAB/Simulink
